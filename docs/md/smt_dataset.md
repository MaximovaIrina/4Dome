# Substance Mapped Textures Dataset
The substance mapped textures dataset consist of 146 textures downloaded from https://archivetextures.net/.
This dataset was used by the retrieve baseline described in the paper. More details of these textures will be made available soon. 
In the meantime, we have provided results of the retrieve baseline using the [stationary textures dataset version 2](./stationary_textures_dataset_v2.md) 
on [our website](https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/plan2scene).
